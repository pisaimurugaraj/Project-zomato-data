# Project-zomato-data
In this notebook, I am going to be analysing the Zomato Bangalore Dataset which I got through Kaggle website. 
The basic idea of analyzing the Zomato dataset is to get a fair idea about the factors affecting the aggregate
rating of each restaurant, establishment of different types of restaurant at different places, Bengaluru being
one such city has more than 12,000 restaurants with restaurants serving dishes from all over the world.
